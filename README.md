# Drifting away
## Game for Ludum Dare 38

[Play the game here](http://bit.ly/2p0IrC1)

This was my first [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/).

It's a 2D top-down HTML5 game made with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).

Point the player with the mouse and use the jetpack with left-click.
