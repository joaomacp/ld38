Theme: "A Small World"

Idea

- Guy with a jetpack wants to leave his world because it's small
- Realizes his fuel is limited, and that big planets are firey and icey and bad
- Game mechanic: avoiding big planets with a small amount of fuel in the jetpack
- Eventually comes back to his planet, and doesn't want to leave it anymore


TODO:

- add another 'goal rock'
- improve scaling and physics
- improve graphics
