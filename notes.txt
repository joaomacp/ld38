Theme: "A Small World"

Idea

- Guy with a jetpack wants to leave his world because it's small
- Realizes his fuel is limited, and that big planets are firey and icey and bad
- Game mechanic: avoiding big planets with a small amount of fuel in the jetpack
- Eventually comes back to his planet, and doesn't want to leave it anymore


TODO:

- add another 'goal rock'
- improve scaling and physics - remove collision with boundaries
- improve graphics - add icons to rocks with fuel cans
- add sfx


Eventually:
- fix rocks angle problem, and getting stuck in rocks
- add animation for fuel reload on rocks
- add a text with the fuelLevel number
- check leaks
