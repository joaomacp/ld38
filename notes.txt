THE GAME IS PLAYABLE: CLICK THE LINK IN THE STREAM DESCRIPTION

Theme: "A Small World"

Idea

- Guy with a jetpack wants to leave his world because it's small
- Realizes his fuel is limited, and that big planets are firey and icey and bad
- Game mechanic: avoiding big planets with a small amount of fuel in the jetpack
- Eventually comes back to his planet, and doesn't want to leave it anymore


TODO:

- cam limits and world bounds

- build full levels

- improve scaling and physics - remove collision with boundaries
- improve graphics
- add sfx
- parallax


Eventually:
- fix rocks angle problem, and getting stuck in rocks
- add animation for fuel reload on rocks
- check leaks
- fade arrow opacity when getting close to the next rock

END - change things up - first rock doesn't have to have fuel.
  Animation of adding fuel can be improved - the can fades
